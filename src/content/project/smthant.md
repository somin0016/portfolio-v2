## Description
This is v02 of my portfolio website! Redesigned and revamped, this latest version serves as both a personal hub and a showcase of my projects, offering visitors a comprehensive glimpse into my journey and accomplishments.

I added dark mode and expanded the website's functionality by adding additional pages such as "About," "Blog," and "Projects" allowing for a more comprehensive exploration of my background, insights, and past endeavors.

To ensure optimal performance and discoverability, I've implemented server-side rendering (SSR), enhancing the website's SEO capabilities and also enabling the publication of articles in the newly added blog section.

*This is the website you're looking at right now!*

[Here](https://portfolio-eta-one-21.vercel.app/) is the version 01!
