## Description
***Notey*** is a Note-taking & Daily Planner Application! This is an `interactive personal productivity application` and it aims to streamline your daily tasks, organize your thoughts, and boost your productivity effortlessly.

### Motivation
I like to take notes, creating a knowledge base, documenting my progresses, sketching my ideas. But all of them are scattered around my workplace, notes are in local notes with no backup, knowledge base is in `Obsidian` etc. So I wanted to create an app, that would help me collect my thoughts. And during development, I wondered "What if it could plan my schedules too, that would be FANTASTIC!?", and thus came `Notey`.

### Features
- a responsive and modern UI with draggable elements and smooth animations
- one-click note-taking, folder hierarchy and planner functionalities(v02)
- `/slash commands` in the WYSIWYG text editor
- content publicity - users can lock their notes, or share with others via a generated public-key link(v02)
- real-time data storage on MySQL database hosted on AWS RDS

*This project is currently under development of v02 and involves three additional team members who share the same objectives.*
