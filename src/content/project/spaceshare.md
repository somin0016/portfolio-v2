**Motivation**: there's a high demand of rooms for rent in singapore, and foreign workers and students wants to share rooms to reduce costs. There're property management apps like 99.co, propertyguru, but don't have a target intended for people who wants to share rooms, that is space. The app aims to be a 'matching-like' platform for people who wants to share space with other like-minded ones.

**What I've done in this project**: 
- came up with the app Name and drafted out possible user-roles
- led frontend development, designed the overall look and feel of the app, built the components together with a teammate
- built auth flow for admin, and APIs for admin module
